# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for **[Linux Mint Tara](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=258)**.

Inspired by: [cowboy/dotfiles](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles).

## Installation

1. Go to **dotfiles** root directory
1. `~/.dotfiles/dotfiles`
1. You can run `dotfiles` by itself next time you open a terminal window

## Features

- **dotfiles** will always backup what it overwrites to `~/.dotfiles/backup`.
- It can revert the installation of links when called with `-u` or `--unlink`.
- For debugging, you can call it with `--dry-run` to view future changes.
